              <div class="post-content">
          <p>today i was basically in bed the whole day . . .</p>
<p>i know that's terrible but I DON'T CARE ! i was getting work done i was just sore and exhausted !</p>
<p>anyway i was mildy amused the whole day because my roommate took like a 8 hr nap ,</p>
<p>even though she did get like 6 hours of sleep last night :D</p>
<p>and since i was also in bed the whole time i would glance at her like every 30 mins or so and be increasingly amused by her nap . even tho it was more of a full night's sleep shift .</p>
<p>and it had me thinking ( since i usually wake up like every 3 hours during the night I DON'T KNOW WHY OKAY ) </p>
<p>that it would be nice to have my dreams have some valid truth to them . . .</p>
<p>okay that's definitely not the way i wan't to word that .</p>
<p>dreamswap - day 5</p>
<p>basically i can choose certain elements of my dreams to be true in the real world .</p>
<p>and if we're talking real shit the extent of this power is insane - it's just the extent of my imagination .</p>
<p>i have a lot of dreams that are about running from somebody chasing me - the government , murderers , lions , that one time i had a dream about a bear trying to break into my room , slenderman . . .</p>
<p>so obviously not those /.</p>
<p>and then i can choose which parts of reality i want to make not real by just making them my dreams . . .</p>
<p>i don't know how that would work realistically but whatever :D</p>        </div>
