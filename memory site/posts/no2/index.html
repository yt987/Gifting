          <p>i had dinner with a friend today , and she asked me a strange question .</p>
<p>if 1 was the worst day of my life, and 10 was the best, what would today be ?</p>
<p>see the issue is i've always felt pretty neutral about these things. </p>
<p>bad things happen all the time - i fail a test , i get sick , etc .</p>
<p>but good things also happen - my sister calls , i eat strawberry ice cream , etc.</p>
<p>so i told her that most days are a 5 for me .</p>
<p>so the superpower of today is a bit unconventional .</p>
<p>day 2 - neutralize</p>
<p>the idea is that regardless of the situation , i am in complete control of the balances of all of my bodily systems - as well as anything in my direct field of observation ( to an extent , obviously ) - and can neutralize them with an equal opposing force .</p>
<p>so a punch to the face would hurt , but i could duplicate that pain for the puncher as well . so the total pain of the system is a net zero . . . i don't know why this became a physics moment but well , </p>
<p>maybe good things are good , and bad things are bad , but maybe neutral is , well , neutral .</p>
<p>i don't really know how to put my thoughts about this into words , but being able to reset everything to a neutral state is the idea !</p>        </div>
